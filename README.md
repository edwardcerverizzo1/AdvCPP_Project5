Find the number of times a word is used and its and location by line and position


Given an input.txt file, this program will output the number of times word used and where its location is in respect to line and position in the line.

e.g.
word [(0,0)]
hello[(3,4) (7,9)]

An important note: Word position and line number start at 0.

"word" is the first word on the first line of the input.txt file. 
and "hello" appears on the 4th line as the 5th word (3,4) and on the 8th line as the 10th word (7,9).
